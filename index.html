				<div class="p">Let your heart be your guide. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. A happy cloud. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. In this world, everything can be happy. Here's something that's fun. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. You are only limited by your imagination. All kinds of happy little splashes.

					If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. It's all a game of angles. We can fix anything.Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Only eight colors that you need. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting.
